Description: Package implementing Bayesian age-period-cohort models with the focus on projections. BAPC uses integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) for full Bayesian inference.  BAPC generates age-specific and age-standardized projected rates. When interest lies in the predictive distribution, Poisson noise is automatically added. The INLA package can be obtained from http://www.r-inla.org . We recommend the testing version, which can be downloaded by running: install.packages("INLA", repos="http://www.math.ntnu.no/inla/R/testing")
